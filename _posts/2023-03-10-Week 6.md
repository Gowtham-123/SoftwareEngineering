Functions in JavaScript are blocks of code that can be called and executed repeatedly throughout your code. Functions allow you to encapsulate a set of instructions that perform a specific task, and can accept arguments and return values to the calling code. Here are some important aspects of functions in JavaScript:

1. Function declaration: Functions in JavaScript can be declared using the function keyword, followed by the function name and the set of parentheses that contain any input arguments.
~~~
function myFunction(arg1, arg2) {
  // function code here
}
~~~
2. Function expression: Functions can also be declared using function expressions, where the function is assigned to a variable.
~~~
var myFunction = function(arg1, arg2) {
  // function code here
};
~~~
3. Arrow function expression: Arrow functions are a shorthand way to declare functions, and are often used in modern JavaScript code.
~~~
const myFunction = (arg1, arg2) => {
  // function code here
};
~~~
4. Function arguments: Functions can accept arguments that are passed in when the function is called.
~~~
function multiply(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}

multiply(2, 3); // returns 6
~~~
5. Function return values: Functions can return a value to the calling code using the return keyword.
~~~
function multiply(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}

var result = multiply(2, 3);
console.log(result); // logs 6
~~~
6. Function scope: Variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function, unless they are declared with the var, let, or const keyword outside of the function.
~~~
function myFunction() {
  var message = "Hello";
  console.log(message); // logs "Hello"
}

myFunction();
console.log(message); // throws an error, since message is not defined outside the function
~~~
Challenges: 

Here are some common challenges i faced while leaning the functions concept
Understanding the syntax and Scoping.To overcome these challenges, it's important for me to practice writing functions and test them frequently.
